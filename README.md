# 🎥 Live Object Detection & Tracking using YOLOv8

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-time AI-powered web application built using **Streamlit** and **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**. It uses a webcam to detect, track, and label objects in real time with bounding boxes.

The system demonstrates how computer vision and artificial intelligence work in live environments by processing video frames instantly.

## 📊 Observation Report

* Detection works best in good lighting conditions
* Objects like person and cellphone are easily detected
* Performance may slow down with low-end devices or poor lighting

---

## 🧠 Reflection

### What objects were easily detected?

Common objects such as person, cellphone, and bottle were easily detected by the model.

### What factors affect detection accuracy?

* Lighting conditions
* Camera quality
* Distance of object
* Background noise/clutter
